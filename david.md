> 2019.06, I graduated from Chengdu University of Information Technology. My major was  software engineering. And I did well in courses like python,C,C++,C#,ASP .net,SQLSERVER and network of computer, which enabled me to get a scholarship. Not only that, I was also good at making schedule properly, thus I got a driving license and CET6 certificate during my spare time.

* *2019-04 - 2019 -10 C# Web Developer IN  REN WO Xing Company*

> This is the beginning of my career. And as a green bird, the project was difficult for me. The work in company was totally different from homework in school. Therefore, I worked hard and made a lot efforts. Finally, I passed three-month internship and got a job. However, it was not suitable for me. Because I was tired of demands like sea water from customers. Or maybe I wasn't ready to be a good coder at that time, so that I chose to leave.

> As an adult, I had to find a new job to make a living, so I came to present company. A year passed quickly, during which two of my colleagues left one after another. The leaders arranged me to take over their work. Meanwhile, I also participated in the development and maintain of a multi-project, which made me very busy. Have you ever seen the sunrise after working all night? I was very impressed with it. But every coin has two sides, my ability has also improved very quickly with a year of intense work. This was inseparable from the help of others, and I am very grateful to the two experienced coders, who are both my superiors and my teachers. And followings are some skills I obtain:
